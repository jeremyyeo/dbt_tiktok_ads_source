# TikTok Ads Source

This package models TikTok Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/tiktok-ads/). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/tiktok-ads#schemainformation).

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following:

* Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
* Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
* Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [TikTok Ads modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_tiktok_ads) and our [multi-platform Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting). The staging models:

* Name columns consistently across all packages:
    * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
    * Timestamps are appended with `_at`
    * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, the advertiser table's ID column is renamed `advertiser_id`.

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/tiktok_ads_source
    version: [">=0.1.0", "<0.2.0"]
```

## Configuration
By default, this package will look for your TikTok Ads data in the `tiktok_ads` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your TikTok Ads data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    tiktok_ads_database: your_database_name
    tiktok_ads_schema: your_schema_name
```

### Changing the Build Schema
By default, this package will build the TikTok Ads staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_tiktok_ads`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your TikTok Ads staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    tiktok_ads_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
## Database Support

This package has been tested on BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Postgres, and Databricks.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration

dbt `v0.20.0` introduced a new project-level dispatch configuration that enables an "override" setting for all dispatched macros. If you are using a Databricks destination with this package, you will need to add the following (or a variation of the following) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` and then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages, respectively.
```yml
# dbt_project.yml

dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```
